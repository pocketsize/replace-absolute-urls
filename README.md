# Replace Absolute URLs

A lightweight WordPress plugin designed to eliminate the need to search and replace URLs in your database when moving a site between development and production environments. It also enables you to access the site using any hostname, without WordPress redirecting to the domain stored in the database.

This plugin is designed for use during development and should not be used in production.

However, setting the site URL to the production domain enables you to move the site to production, without search and replacing the database.
